docker images are defined application encapsulations which are used to run containers.

docker images have a repository, a tag, an image id, a created time, and a size. you can see the existing images on your machine with ``docker image ls``.

a dockerfile defines a docker image, once it is built. 

docker images can be built ``build``, tagged ``tag`` and pushed to a repo ``push``.
